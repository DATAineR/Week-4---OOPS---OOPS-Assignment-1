    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.\n",
    "It helps in hiding the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world and allows controlled access to the data through methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class).\n",
    "It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes, where a subclass can reuse the attributes and methods of its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
    "It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, and it can take multiple forms, such as method overloading and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors, while ignoring non-essential details.\n",
    "It provides a way to provide a high-level view of an object, focusing on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality"

    "\n",
    "Here are the key reasons why self is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accessing Instance Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "self allows access to the instance variables of the class. When a method is called on an object, self refers to that specific instance, enabling access to its unique attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Invoking Instance Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "self is used to invoke other methods within the same class. Without self, the method might not know which instance it is operating on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating Instance-Specific Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the __init__ method (constructor), self is used to create and initialize instance-specific attributes. It distinguishes between the instance's attributes and local variables within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Maintaining Object State:\n",
    "\n",
    "self is crucial for maintaining the state of an object. It allows an instance to refer to its own data, ensuring that each object can operate independently with its own set of attributes."
